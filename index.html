									<h1>The Game</h1>
									<p>Just like in spy movies, you can play a field game against your friends in a real-world setting. You can win regardless of whether you are an athlete, intellect, or social butterfly. What is your strategy?</p>

								<p>Video games meets real life in Domain (formerly Hacker), a secret-identity team-based game of tag. Inspired by physical games such as Assassin, and secret-identity card games, Domain is a location-based, mobile game, made for 6 players. Two teams track, identify, and attack each other. The team with the most successful attacks win.</p>
							
								
 <p>With Domain you can turn the world around you into a fast-paced field game. Find your team, discover your enemies, and attack them through stealth, speed, and deception. Show your friends that you are the slyest secret agent. You can create a game session/room for 4 or 6 players.</p>
								
<p> This location-based game is played within a 2 block by 2 block field and uses your GPS location only within its 15 min playtime. Everyone starts the game with a secret team alliance, and the team with the most points by the end of the game wins!</p>

							
									<p> First collect intel. Tapping a terminal within your range gives you half a hack and allows you to track your enemies or allies. This means, you could see their live locations for 30 seconds.</p>
								
								
						<p>Next, hack another player. To initiate a hack, find a player, and tap on them when they are within range. During the hack, the hacker must keep their opponent within range for 5 seconds for success. Be careful. Your team loses a point if you hack the wrong player. </p>






<p>Made for college students and to be played on a school campus, Domain is all about you and your friends. What is your story?
